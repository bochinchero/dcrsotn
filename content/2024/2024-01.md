### Transaction Volume
_Transaction Volume is a measure of the economic throughput by estimating the daily volume of coins that have been transfered using the Decred Network. [Coinmetrics' adjusted transaction volume](https://coinmetrics.io/introducing-adjusted-estimates/) removes obvious change and outputs spent within 4 blocks of their first expenditure to substract out the self-churn typical of exchanges, mixers, and stress test._

During the month of January, the daily adjusted transaction volume in DCR as tracked by Coinmetrics opened at 161,877.99 DCR and closed at 171,015.68 DCR, reaching a high of 415,886.44 DCR on 2024-01-19 and a low of 38,794.96 DCR on 2024-01-14.

### Voting Service Providers
_Voting Service Providers (VSPs) offer a service whereby ticket buyers can delegate the act of voting to the VSP. The ticket-buyer instructs the VSP how their ticket should vote on any open rule change proposals, and shares voting rights with the VSP to take advantage of the voting infrastructure they provide (i.e. at least three always-online servers)._

_VSPs charge a fee for this service, which is paid upfront before the ticket is added to the VSPs voting wallets. This fee is generally 5% or less. VSPs do not take custody of DCR. By using them, you only delegate the voting rights of a ticket._

As of February 1<sup>st</sup>, public Voting Service Providers are voting for a share of {vspShare.value} of the live tickets in the Ticket Pool.

![Live Ticket Distribution](https://github.com/bochinchero/dcrsnapshots/blob/main/2024-01/1920/Live%20Ticket%20Distribution.png?raw=true "Live Ticket Distribution")
