<h3>Voting Service Providers</h3>
<p><em>Voting Service Providers (VSPs) offer a service whereby ticket buyers can delegate the act of voting to the VSP. The ticket-buyer instructs the VSP how their ticket should vote on any open rule change proposals, and shares voting rights with the VSP to take advantage of the voting infrastructure they provide (i.e. at least three always-online servers).</em></p>
<p><em>VSPs charge a fee for this service, which is paid upfront before the ticket is added to the VSPs voting wallets. This fee is generally 5% or less. VSPs do not take custody of DCR. By using them, you only delegate the voting rights of a ticket.</em></p>
<p>As of {Issue.NextMonth}1<sup>st</sup>, public Voting Service Providers are voting for a share of {vspShare.value} of the live tickets in the Ticket Pool.</p>
